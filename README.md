#Hello there! It's Satriya!

  I'm an informatics student at Universitas Teknologi Yogyakarta, Indonesia. I just started my programming path a semester ago. Starting up with python and take a mini bootcamp course
by Progate on python. Also got more programming strength at my university. Currently, my goals is to be Fullstack developer. Why fullstack? in my thought, learning programming
on both sides (frontend and backend) will strengthen my programming skill well because I know how both sides working and integrating each other.

What am i interested in?
- Backend programming
  Server side programming is such an art for me. It's such a beauty to understand how web or application work on the backstage. I'm currently studying on PHP as my university
  course. But, I'm looking forward to learn more about the javascript as a server side programming (node.js). 
- JavaScript 
  In my opinion, JavaScript is very useful programming languange to build on client side and also server side.
- Python
  Python is less difficult to understand and so many functionality to build algorithm, also implementing many programming branches. Such as Machine Learning, AI, and many more.
- Web 
  Currently, I'm looking forward to learn build a website to strengthen my programming skills and jump into the industry as fast as possible.
